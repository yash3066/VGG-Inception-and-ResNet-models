# VGG-Inception-and-ResNet-models
Here, I have implemented VGG16, Inception and ResNet50 models.

## 1) VGG-16 Module
 - VGG stands for Visual Geometry Group,it is an academic group focused on computer vision at Oxford University. VGG netwrok was the runner-up at the ILSVRC-2014 challenge. 
 - The key innovation in this architecture was the definition and repetition of what we will refer to as VGG-blocks. These are groups of convolutional layers that use small filters (e.g. 3Ã—3 pixels) followed by a max pooling layer.

 - Following is the architecture of the VGG-16 model. Used in the original paper by __Karen Simonyan__, __Andrew Zisserman__.

## 2) Inception Module
- Inception module was described and used in the GoogleNet module, which won the ILSVRC-2014 challenge.
