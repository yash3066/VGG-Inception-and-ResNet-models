# VGG-Inception-and-ResNet-models
Here, we have implemented VGG16, Inception and REsNet50 models.

## 1) VGG-16
 - VGG stands for Visual Geometry Group,it is an academic group focused on computer vision at Oxford University. VGG netwrok was the runner-up at the ILSVRC-2014 challenge.
 - Following is the architecture of the VGG-16 model. Used in the original paper by __Karen Simonyan__, __Andrew Zisserman__.
